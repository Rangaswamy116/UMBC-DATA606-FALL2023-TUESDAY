>**RELEVANT PROJECTS AND INTERNSHIPS:**

**Credit card Fraud Detection**

* Developed an advanced credit card fraud detection system harnessing the capabilities of machine learning and big data analytics. This project aimed to safeguard financial transactions by identifying fraudulent activities with high accuracy.
* The heart of the system consisted of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and deep neural networks. These algorithms were trained on historical transaction data to learn patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior. We employed feature engineering to extract meaningful information from transaction attributes, improving model performance.
* Overall, our credit card fraud detection system proved highly effective, providing a secure and reliable defense against fraudulent activities, ultimately safeguarding the financial interests of both consumers and businesses

<B>Movie Recommendation System</B>

* We have taken an unsupervised data where the dataset has colums such as Movie genres, release years , actor names and director names. fruther the data has been split to test and train data, now the data is trained with optimization algorithm such as gradient descent 
* Finally the model is used to make movie recommendations for new users based on their preferences 

**Flight prediction Analysis**

* Developed a flight delay prediction system utilizing historical data. The dataset was divided into training and testing sets. Leveraged Apache Spark's regression algorithms to create predictive models. 
* The project also involved data visualization to meet specific flight-related requirements, providing valuable insights into estimated flight delays.
